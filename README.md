# Medical Clinic Front-end

A responsive front-end web application for a medical clinic, built as a personal project to practice **React**, **UI/UX design**, and **component-based development**.

The goal of this project was to design a clean, professional medical website interface and translate a UI concept into a functional React application.

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses entirely on the **front-end experience** of a medical clinic website.  
I researched real clinic websites, designed layouts in Canva, and implemented the UI using React and CSS.
